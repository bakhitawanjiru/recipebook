           <ul>
            Pork dumplings are a delicious and popular dish in many Asian cuisines, especially Chinese cuisine. They typically consist of a filling made from ground pork, along with a variety of seasonings, vegetables, and sometimes mushrooms or ginger. The filling is wrapped in a thin dough, then steamed, boiled, or pan-fried.

Here’s a basic recipe for making pork dumplings:

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
For the dumpling filling:
<li>1 lb ground pork</li> 
 <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li> 
 <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li> 
 <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li> 
 <li> 1 tablespoon ginger, finely grated</li> 
 <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
 <li>1/4 cup green onions, finely chopped</li> 
 <li>1/2 cup napa cabbage, finely chopped (optional)</li> 
 <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li> 
<li> 1/2 teaspoon white pepper (or black pepper)</li> 
 <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li> 
</ul>

 <h2>Method:</h2>
 <ol>
          

 <h3> Make the filling:</h3>
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground pork, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, green onions, cabbage (if using), sugar, white pepper, and salt. Mix everything together until well-combined. You can also use your hands to mix for a better texture.
  
<h3>Prepare the dumpling wrappers: </h3>
   - If using store-bought wrappers, keep them covered with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out.
  
<h3>Assemble the dumplings: </h3>
   - Place a wrapper on your hand or a flat surface. Spoon about a tablespoon of filling into the center of the wrapper. Be careful not to overfill.
   - Fold the wrapper in half to create a half-moon shape, pressing the edges to seal. You can pleat the edges for a more traditional look.
  
<h3>Cook the dumplings: </h3>
   - Boiling: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Drop in the dumplings and cook for about 4-6 minutes or until they float and are fully cooked through.
   - Steaming: Place the dumplings in a bamboo steamer lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. Steam for about 10-12 minutes.
   - Pan-frying (potsticker style): Heat some oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until the bottom is golden. Add about 1/4 cup of water to the pan, cover, and let the dumplings steam for another 5-6 minutes until cooked through.

 <h3>Serve: </h3>
   - Serve your pork dumplings with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a little sesame oil, or your favorite dipping sauce.

Enjoy your homemade pork dumplings! They’re great for a cozy meal, a snack, or as part of a larger feast.
